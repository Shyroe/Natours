# Natours
Responsive interface, development in SASS (CSS preprocessor) and BEM (CSS architecture).
Front-End project (CSS only) mobile responsive and desktop responsive, made with Css preprocessor (SASS) and Css architecture (BEM).

The idea of the project is to create a complex interface and apply concepts from CSS code to make the project scalable and also create fantastic animations and effects, just using the CSS style language.
